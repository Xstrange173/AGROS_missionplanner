# 🌾 AGROS Mission Command: The Future of Precision Agriculture

> **Nidar (Visionary Precision)** – Empowering farmers with intelligent drone-based crop management.

AGROS Mission Command is a unified Ground Control Station (GCS) designed specifically for autonomous agricultural spraying missions. By integrating real-time computer vision with ArduPilot-based mission planning, AGROS enables precise, efficient, and effortless target detection and treatment.

## 🛠️ The Procedure: How it Works

1. **Scan**: Launch the **Live Vision System** and start the scanning drone. AGROS will automatically identify targets (e.g., weeds or infected plants) and capture their GPS coordinates.
2. **Review**: Go to the **Plan & Generate** tab. Review the captured images, confidence scores, and timestamps. Filter or manually select the targets you want to treat.
3. **Generate**: Click **Generate Mission File** to create a standard `.waypoints` file perfectly compatible with **Mission Planner**.
4. **Link**: Use the **🚀 LINK MISSION PLANNER** button to open your control software and establish a MAVLink bridge.
5. **Treat**: Deploy your spray drone by uploading the generated mission directly from the AGROS UI.
